The Platform for Single-Cell Science (PSCS) is a project intending to make findings in single-cell more reliable.
We aim to achieve this in three ways:  
- Host and distribute user-defined analysis pipelines.
- Store and report results of published pipelines.
- Make pipeline development accessible.
