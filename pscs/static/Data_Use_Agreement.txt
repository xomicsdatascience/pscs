    Data Privacy

a. By default, data uploaded by the User is private and will not be accessed, other than:
1) by other users explicitly approved by the User (e.g., project collaborators),
2) by other users explicitly approved by users empowered to do so by the User (e.g., collaborators added by project administrators) or those similarly-derived (e.g., collaborators added by a chain of approved project administrators),
3) for automated data handling operations (e.g., extracting metadata, compression, encryption),
4) for processing as requested by the User (e.g., data analysis).

b. Company shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the User’s data.

    Data Deletion
a. Data that is deleted is removed from the server hosting the data.
b. Metadata related to the data will be temporarily retained for internal use.
c. Depending on the system's backup schedule, data marked for deletion could be retained in system backups.
d. In the event of a system restore where a previous version of the database is used instead of the latest version, the retained metadata is used to ensure that deleted data is not later restored.
e. Once all system backups are certain to not contain data marked for deletion, the retained metadata is deleted.

    Publication

a. Once the User marks the data for publication, it will be held for 3 days. During this period, the User can revoke the data's publication status.

b. If the User does not revoke the data's publication status during the 3-day period, it will be published, and the User surrenders the right to delete the data.
